Legacy Actionscript 3.0 code for Flash Applications

These Flash apps were designed to work in Moodle LMS.

Flash Player's end of life has been announced by Adobe.

I'm making my AS 3.0 library free and open source (GPL3) so that these apps can be ported to HTML+CSS+JS.

It'd be nice if these apps could be turned into activity modules for Moodle.

Actionscript 3.0 and Javascript are very similar and porting shoudln't be difficult.

I'm really busy and don't have the time to port this code.

Please contact me if you'd like to have a go!

Matt :)

BTW, FlashDevelop is a free and open source Flash & Actionscript IDE
