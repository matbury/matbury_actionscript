Legacy Actionscript 3.0 code for Flash Applications

These Flash apps were designed to work in Moodle LMS.

Flash Player's end of life has been announced by Adobe.

I'm making my AS 3.0 library free and open source (GPL3) so that these apps can be ported to HTML+CSS+JS.

It'd be nice if these apps could be turned into activity modules for Moodle.

Please contact me if you'd like to have a go!

Matt :)
